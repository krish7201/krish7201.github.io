To run locally:
- I used powershell last time for all of this
- Install nodejs from (https://nodejs.org/en/download/current) (I used chocolatey this last time from a failed install of the prebuilt node.js)
- install http-server (https://github.com/http-party/http-server) with "npm install --global http-server"
- run "http-server -p 3000"

problem with NPM, not verified digital signature on NPM.ps1. Use this in PowerShell to bypass the issue: Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -Scope Process
dev server: http-server -p 3000
